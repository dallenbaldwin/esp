## A word of caution

I was not able to get the Student upgraded Pro Account at time of this assignment's submission. That means the code is readily available to you in this Public Repository.

If you are copying and pasting my code... I'm sorry for your loss. You probably could have done it easier. Please don't. You will get caught and we'll both get in trouble.

## NOTE

Only works on Chrome Web browser for now.
